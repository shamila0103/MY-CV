          I've worked on different projects, like making a smart assistant and
          creating websites. With Python, I built a smart assistant that can
          understand and respond to human language. I also made websites using
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making them look good and work well on
          different devices. These projects show my skills in programming and
          problem-solving.
